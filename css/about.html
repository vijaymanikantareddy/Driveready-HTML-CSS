        <p>A web page (or webpage) is a hypertext document on the World Wide Web. Web pages are delivered by a web server to the user and displayed in a web browser. A website consists of many web pages linked together under a common domain name. The name "web page" is a metaphor of paper pages bound together into a book.
            The core element of a web page is a text file written in the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)[2] that describes the content of the web page and includes references to other web resources. A web page is a structured document that primarily consists of hypertext, text with hyperlinks. Hyperlinks point the user to other web resources, primarily other web pages, and to different sections of the same web page. Multimedia content on the web, such as images, videos, and other web pages, can be directly embedded in a web page to form a compound document.

An HTML document can include Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) documents to describe the presentation of content on a web page. It can also include JavaScript or WebAssembly programs, which are executed by the web browser to add dynamic behavior to the web page.[2][3] Web pages with dynamic behavior can function as application software, referred to as web applications

        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
            when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
            It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.<br>
            It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem
            Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum</p>
